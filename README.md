FAQ: HOW DO I START??
Answer:

1. Make sure to discuss your ideas with the community in an Project board or on the Discord channel.
2. Take a look on the Project board, create the issue for the task you think is need to be done and label it according to "UI" or "Features", "Bug" etc, then assign to yourself.
3. If you have too much to work on an issue you can label it as "help-wanted", so people can work on that item with you.
4. Before starting to write code, make sure to pull from DEV branch. So you can have a latest build of application.
   Then create a new branch according to your task that you are working on, for example mark_your_location branch.
5. If you are at this point, you really want to do or you did some great work. After task completion create a pull request from your to DEV. So other developers can review your code and then merge to DEV.
